# Digital Access Divide
Owen Cheung, Jason Lim, Truong Le, Shirley Hu

## Primary goal/purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to provide datasets and visualizations of this data through maps and charts to show any gaps in internet access among communities in the South King County and Pierce County regions. Another goal for this project is to consolidate the data visualizations into a report and make sure its contents are clear and understandable to anyone using it by thoroughly explaining each graph, how we created it and analysis on why it is relevant to the purpose of the project which is to depict any gaps in digital access in some of these communities in order to address the issue. These visualizations will be used to make a case for continued support and funding to provide digital devices and broadband access to those without it. We also want to be able to emphasize areas of note such as dead zones which indicate a lack of internet and digital connection, either through a map or chart visualization for readability. Our analysis will include creating a composite index for different variables (devices per household, strength of internet connectivity, type of internet subscriptions, among others) to indicate the levels of digital accessibility in these counties. Because resources are very limited, with our proposed idea, this will give our sponsor ideas of locations that are in critical need of computer access and should be prioritized first.

## Proposal

Looking at the digital divide can be very difficult because there are many variables that must be analyzed. Because of this, we have decided on creating a slide deck to present our findings, followed by a report to give our audience a better understanding of our findings from our analysis, and explain about the variables that are presented. In our presentation, we will present summaries on our findings in income and education level in each households, locations with public internet access, connectivity/strength of signal of internet (type of internet subscription like fixed broadband or mobile broadband/cellular data, internet speed), and number of computers/digital devices per household, and households with digital devices but does not have access to the internet. 

## Tasks and timeline

| Week    | Description |
|---------|-------------|
|Week 2|<ul><li>Make a list of important variables to accessibility like devices per household and strength of broadband connectivity. These will help us organize the different sections of the report.</li><li>Finish and revise scope of project, submit it to the sponsor for feedback</li></ul>|
|Week 3 ~ 4| <ul><li>Receive feedback for project scope from sponsor, address any feedback/modify scope as necessary</li><li>Begin collecting datasets/important information that we need for our analysis</li></ul><li>Start project report and slide presentation by filling in the different sections we will cover such as device and internet access. </li></ul>|
|Week 5 ~ 6|<ul><li>Deciding how we are going to present each section in our final report and begin analysis of the variables determined above. </li><li>Present a rough outline of our report and get feedback from sponsor in bi-weekly meeting.</li></ul>|
|Week 7 ~ 8|<ul><li>After receiving feedback from our sponsor, work on further developing analyses and visualizations for the report including composite indexes for each variable. </li><li>Add key visualizations and conclusions to the presentation. </li></ul>|
|Week 9|<ul><li>We will create a written report on the variables that were presented in our visualizations, and the impact they have in supporting our claims. If there are issues in our final presentation, this week will give us extra time to debug any issues.</li><li>Practice for final presentation.</li></ul>|
Week 10|<ul><li>Presentation, transfer deliverables to the sponsor</li>|

## Task allocation

**Shirley**

- Collect data on number and type of computers/digital devices per household and households with internet access

**Jason**

- Collect data on households without direct access to internet as well as households that do not have access to internet at all (nearby public libraries or any kind of internet access) and what type of internet households are using i.e. cellular data / broadband / satellite / a fixed wireless subscription, non dial up subscription types 

**Owen**

- Collect data on locations with internet access and how accessible they are (i.e. distance), help Truong with their analysis

**Truong**

- Collect data of income level of each households and create an analysis
    - Talk about bachelor degrees of each households
